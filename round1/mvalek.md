# Crowdsourcing Project Idea: [Penn Political Compass]

## Problem Statement
Similar to the actual Political Compass, this project has a hidden feature: it is specifically applicable to Penn students. So the user will get a general Political Compass location but also one that is based on the opinions of the Penn student body. Penn is a very liberal place where, for instance, most people (hopefully) believe gay people exist lol (in case someone would oppose this, this would have a significant impact on their "Penn-Specific" score).

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** A Political Compass that shows you where you stand both in the grand political spectrum and within Penn's unique campus culture.

**Target users:** Penn students curious about their political identity.

**The crowd:** Penn students

**The task:** Answer political opinion-based questions and get a dual-axis political compass positioning based on their answers: one for the general population and one relative to the Penn student body.

## Key Features
1. The Dual Compass Visualization: The core result is a single graph with two dots: one showing your position on a standard Political Compass (Economic Left/Right, Social Libertarian/Authoritarian), and a second, uniquely colored dot showing your position relative to the Penn student average. This instantly shows how "mainstream" or "deviant" your views are within the Penn context.
2. Penn-Centric Question Bank: The quiz includes standard political questions mixed with issues hyper-relevant to campus life (e.g., "The University should divest from fossil fuels," "Greek life has a net positive impact on campus culture," "Paying student athletes is a fair practice."). This makes the quiz feel immediately relevant and engaging.
3. Interactive Results & Filters: After seeing their results, users can filter the aggregated data by school (e.g., Wharton vs. College of Arts & Sciences), year, or other anonymized demographics to see how their "Penn Compass" changes when compared to different sub-communities.

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** Data will come directly from Penn students via the quiz. They will get to know their political compass positioning only after a minimum number of responses (e.g., 50-100) are accumulated to ensure the "Penn Average" has meaning.

**Budget reality:** free

**Crowd size needed:** Preferably more than 100 to generate a meaningful "Penn Average." A few hundred would provide robust data for sub-group filters.

**Quality control approach:** Since this is supposed to be subjective opinions, quality is about sincerity, not correctness. To filter trolls: if someone votes only all extremes (e.g., maximum right/authoritarian on every single question without variation), their input will be discarded as low-effort/noise. We can also include an "attention check" question mid-quiz (e.g., "Please select 'Somewhat Agree' for this statement to show you are paying attention").

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** Answering a series of political opinion questions on a Likert scale (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree).

**Automated tasks:** Scoring individual responses on the two standard Political Compass axes. Calculating the aggregate average and distribution for each question to establish the "Penn Baseline." Generating the personalized dual-compass visualization. Powering the filtering system for the results dashboard.

**Aggregation method:** Calculates the Z-score or a simple deviation of the user's answer for each question from the Penn student average. A user's overall "Penn Compass" position is the average of these deviations across economically- and socially-focused questions. This shows how many standard deviations they are from the Penn norm.

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:** The Original Political Compass (politicalcompass.org): Differs because it is global and generic. Ours is localized, social, and provides immediate, relatable context by comparing you to your peers.

**Lessons from past course projects:** The result is the incentive. People love personalized results and data about their community. The "one-week delay" is a good idea to build a initial crowd, but even immediate results showing a "provisional" Penn average that gets more precise as more people take it could work.

## Why This Could Work
This project is perfectly viable within the course constraints because it has a clear, finite task and a powerful, intrinsic incentive—curiosity about oneself and one's community. The data is self-generated by the target audience, and the technical implementation is a manageable combination of a form, a database, and a visualization algorithm. The "Penn-specific" angle makes it inherently relevant and shareable within the campus bubble, driving the necessary crowd participation.
